		About Justin Tu
	</h1>

	<p>
		I enjoy learning; whether its from school, reading, videos, or private lessons. I also enjoy helping out my peers. In my spare time, I play indie video games and watch classic TV shows.
		<br>
		<br>
		When it comes to work, I follow the standard of excellence that my high school band teacher taught me: Do your best, look for improvement, and make those improvements. Unlike perfection, you can achieve excellence. But you have to pursue excellence to achieve it. I've pursued excellence ever since my teacher taught me about it.
		<br>
		<br>
		Right I'm most familiar with Java and deal mainly with back-end programming, but I also have some experience with C and HTML.
