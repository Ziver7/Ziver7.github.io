<h1>Justin Tu</h1>

<p class="center">
	I program in Java and other languages while holding myself to a standard of excellence. 
</p>


<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I enjoy learning; whether its from school, reading, videos, or private lessons. I also enjoy helping out my peers. In my spare time, I play indie video games and watch classic TV shows.
	<br>
	<br>
	When it comes to work, I follow the standard of excellence that my high school band teacher taught me: Do your best, look for improvement, and make those improvements. Unlike perfection, you can achieve excellence. But you have to pursue excellence to achieve it. I've pursued excellence ever since my teacher taught me about it.
	<br>
	<br>
	Right I'm most familiar with Java and deal mainly with back-end programming, but I also have some experience with C and HTML.

<h3>Dave Sent Me</h3>

</p>


<p>
	Three programmers and I won first place at Outside Hacks 2015 with a personalized schedule recommender for Outside Lands 2015. We named our app "Dave Sent Me." I implemented GraceNote's Web API using HTML and JavaScript so that our recommender could pull artist information. I had never used HTML before this hackathon, and I had little JavaScript experience. You can read the article about our app <a href="https://www.fest300.com/magazine/a-hackathon-just-made-
	your-outside-lands-better">here</a>.

<h3>Mancala in Java</h3>
<p>
	Two student programmers and I created the Mancala board game in Java. It had almost all functionality, made use of the Model Viwer Controller pattern, and Java Swing. I programmed the parent classes, and interfaces that our program used, I helped implement the MVC pattern and the JComponents. The only non-functional feature was a special rule where if the last piece a player drop is in an empty hole on his or her side, he or she captures that piece and any pieces in the hole directly opposite of the empty hole.
